VisionaryDesign is an iOS mobile application where people can browse through the available models of furniture and categories, such as tables, chairs, beds, etc. With the help of the Augumented Reality, the user can choose a piece of furniture and place it whenever he/she wants, rotate it and visualise it in order to determine if it's suitable for him, if it fits in the desired space or decide if it's worth buying.
